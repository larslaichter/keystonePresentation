1. ARE YOU A ROCK? (10s)
	– Can you read what it says? 

2. IT SAYS: ARE YOU A ROCK? (40s)
	– Now you can see
	– Lars Laichter, Czech Republic, What are the limits of the mind? 
	– Study: philosophy of mind 
	– Take you to the edge of understanding of the mind – talk about consciousness 
	– This questions is about how we understand the world. 
	– Is everything physcial? Can we understand everything in physcial terms? 
	– Or is there something non-physcial, especially about nature of the mind? 

3. ––––––––

4. WHY: OURSELVES (10s)
	– Some people argue that the mind makes us who we are. 
	– Understanding the mind would allow us to understand ourselves. 

5. WHY: OTHER ORGANISMS (10s)
	– Uderstanding the nature of the mind would allow us to know if we are different from other organisms and determine how we should treat them. 

6. WHY: OTHER OBJECTS (15s)
	– Uderstanding the nature of mind would allow us to also determine if we are somehow different from other objects, such as intelligent machines. 
	– This might come in particularly handy when your are competing for a job with a machine. 

7. ROCK? (10s)
	– Raise hand if YES or if NOT  

8.IF YES (40s)
	– consider mary in a B&W room 
	– mary knows all physcial information about colour 
	– when released, she learns something new
	– therefore, not all infromation about experience is physcial 

9. IF NOT (40s)
	– consider ma rock person
	– very unlikely event occurs 
	– all molecules arrange precisely to form a person > appears possible
	– What is the additional thing? 

10. HARD X EASY (40s)
	– philosopher's distinction 
	– easy problem: problems we can explain in physical terms (ex. attention, sleep)
	– hard problem: the problem of explaining conscious experience 

11. IT IS LIKE SOMETHING (50s)
	– it is like something to taste your morning coffee
	– it is like something to walk through a field of grass
	– it is like something to smell a piece of meat roasting on the fire 
	– it is like something to feel cold rain on your skin 

12. DILEMMA
	– we don't know how to account for conscious experience in physical terms. 
	– either we have to reject the obvious fact that we are experience something or we have to reject physicalism as incomplete. 

13. ILLUSIONISM (30s)
	– don't lose hope! there is a middle way! 
	– our conscious experiences are only illusions similar to other illusion 

14. CONCEIVABLE? (10s)
	– Raise hand if YES or if NOT  
 
15. IF YES (40 s)
	– consider illusion meta-problem 
	– it appears difficult to conceive that the illusion of consciousness would be true 
	– My hands could be illusory, but my experiences? 

16. IF NOT (40 s)
	– consider an example of an illusion

17. CONCEIVABILITY CRITERIA (50s)
	– What should criteria an account of the illusion of consciousness meet? 
	– One is the definitional criterion: provide an explicit defintion of illusion
	– What is an illusion? 
	– Not contained in current discourse 
	– It is not even clear if we should go with illusion or hallucination
	– I try to reconcile that with my definition

18. TOOLS (40 s)
	– epistemic logic: beliefs and states of agents 
	– an agent 
	– an object 
	– a represenation: abundant construct in cognitive science
	– think of it as a map that the agent constructs to understand the world 

19. PROPERTY ILLUSION (30s)

20. EXISTENCE ILLUSION (30s)

21. SUPER-ILLUSION (30s)

22. ALL CRITERIA (10s)
	– you managed to get through the fist criterion: prviding a definition of illusion 
	– if you are serious about conceiving of the illusion of consciousnes: there are for more 
	– read my keystone, invite me for coffee and let's talk about it 
23. CONCLUSION (10s)
	– Are we rocks? I am not sure. At minimum, we that convince themsevles of their exceptionality in a very interesting way.
